# Library Management System
Engineered a C++ Library Management System leveraging object-oriented programming to streamline the management of book and student records. Key functionalities include book cataloging with options to add, modify, and display book details, as well as student record management with admission tracking. The system enforces single-book issuance per student and calculates late return fines based on due dates, ensuring real-time status updates.

File handling is integrated to persistently store and update records, enabling seamless data retrieval across sessions. Core classes, Book and Student, encapsulate attributes such as book ID, title, author, and student admission number, with robust data validation algorithms to prevent multiple book issuances. Conditional logic and input-output manipulators enhance the user interface, providing clear, formatted reports on book and student status. This project demonstrates advanced skills in data persistence, OOP, control structures, and fine-tuned C++ I/O handling, tailored for comprehensive library management functionality."
